# practice combining variables in a string. string concatenation.
one = "hello"
two = "my"
three = "name"
four = "is"
five = "ross"
six = "and"
seven = "I"
eight = "like"
nine = "ruby"



puts("#{one} #{two} #{three} #{four} #{five} #{six} #{seven} #{eight} #{nine}.")
# here I tried this with single quotes. Double quotes is what I needed.
