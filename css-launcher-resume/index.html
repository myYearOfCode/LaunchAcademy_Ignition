    <p>
      I like lots of things. I like coding and robots and tinkering and welding and brewing beer and photography and rockclimbing and riding bikes and making food. I used to make tv commercials for a living. I went to space camp. I used to work for red bull and starbucks at the same time. I also once worked on a glacier and got to snowboard all summer long. I like to do things, and I like to learn things. Soon I'll be a software engineer!
